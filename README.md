# word-guessing-game
A simple word-guessing game made during my Python class online, probably not so great for beginners to understand how the code works and perfect for professionals to correct my coding mistakes.

## Version 1.1.1:
Changes:
  - Fixed a bug

## How to add and remove words and definitions:
Leave 2 lines for each word and definition. The first line contains the word itself and the second one contains the definition matching the word. After each word and definition, leave a blank line so the game can detect the next word, and definition as well.

## Help:
I am currently needing help with commenting on my code and defining functions due to the repetitive code. Make a pull request and I will check it out. If you think I shouldn't overcomment my code, just tell me. Also, please help me write nice-looking code. My code now just looks pretentious with the wannabe professional commentary in my code.

## Bugs:
You know what to do when you find a bug, make an issue and I'll see about that.
