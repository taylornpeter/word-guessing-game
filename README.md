# word-guessing-game
A simple word-guessing game made during my Python class online, probably great for beginners to understand how the code works and great for professionals to correct my coding mistakes.

## Version 1.1.0:
Changes:
  - A new way to configure words and definitions.
  - New words and definitions by default.

## How to add and remove words and definitions:
Each line of the words.txt file corresponds to each line of the definitions.txt file. Feel free to add and remove words and definitions in the txt files but remember to move to the next line if you want to add a new word and definition.

## Help:
I am currently needing help with commenting on my code and defining functions due to the repetitive code. Make a pull request and I will check it out. If you think I shouldn't overcomment my code, just tell me.

## Bugs:
You know what to do when you find a bug, make an issue and I'll see about that.
