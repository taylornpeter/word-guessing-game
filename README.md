# word-guessing-game
A simple word-guessing game made during my Python class online, probably great for beginners.

## Help:
I am currently needing help with commenting on my code and defining functions due to the repetitive code. Make a pull request and I will check it out. If you think I shouldn't overcomment my code, just tell me.

## Bugs:
You know what to do when you find a bug, make an issue and I'll see about that.
